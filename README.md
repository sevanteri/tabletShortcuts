tabletShortcuts
===============

Shortcut UI for my Lenovo x230t. Uses python3 and pyQt5.
Works only through touch. Might add support for adding more devices to trigger the UI.

Depends on:

pyQt5
python-evdev


Installation
============

Just clone somewhere :D


Run
===

Just run run.sh. Running the script again hides/shows the view.

Left edge click opens the view too.


TODO
====

* Clean up the whole thing
* Make into a proper python package
* Ditch run.sh
